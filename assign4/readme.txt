Zach's Reflection
In completing this assignment, I have learned a lot about the process of programming and debugging. We spent around 10 to 12 hours on this assignment, and only a quarter of we were actually coding. The rest of the time was debugging. Sometimes, it was annoying. Especially, small things that seemed to cascade into bigger things. Sometimes, it was fun. It was a game of discovery and figuring out what was wrong. In the end, I felt accomplished that my code was not giving any errors, and seemed to be working as it should.
