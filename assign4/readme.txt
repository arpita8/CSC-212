Zach's Reflection
In completing this assignment, I have learned a lot about the process of programming and debugging. We spent around 10 to 12 hours on this assignment, and only a quarter of we were actually coding. The rest of the time was debugging. Sometimes, it was annoying. Especially, small things that seemed to cascade into bigger things. Sometimes, it was fun. It was a game of discovery and figuring out what was wrong. In the end, I felt accomplished that my code was not giving any errors, and seemed to be working as it should.

This programming assignment was as rewarding as it was challenging. I really enjoy working with lists. It like visualizing them and getting a sense of what is going on. GUIs can be frustrating at times. We spent a substantial amount of debugging. Some of it was fun. Adding if-then conditions to our event handlers was really interesting as it involved a lot of play on logic. Not all parts of debugging was fun. We spent a substantial amount of time fixing our code when the actual "error" was that we had not added our mouse motion listener. Next time I spend more than 2 hours on debugging, I am just going to take a break or at least seek help because most of the times, all you need is just for a new pair of eyes to see your code and see where you have gone wrong. I think I have gotten better at debugging too. Usually I write programs as if I am free writing a creative piece of writing which I know is a bad programming practice. I am learning to get over this habit of mine and debug my program as I go.
