Final - Stage 1

For this stage of the final, I chose to do an undirected graph. My print command is not very clear and I probably could have done a better job at making it. I also could have added traversals, shortest path and other methods to the graph class.

Final - Stage 2

I had a lot of trouble with this. You have to click the upper left hand corner to do anything. The recordHead does not seem to reset after an edge is added or removed. I know I didn't use the input in my GUI. I feel as though my project is below the level of what I could've done.
