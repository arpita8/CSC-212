This assignment has made me wonder about the benefits of Java over Python, and if there are any. In Python, the syntax seems very simple and make sense. In Java, the syntax is bulky and does not seem to make any sense. Things that are very simple in Python are overly complicated in Java. Even the basic print comand is more complicated in Java. Declaring types of every variable makes me think that Java is an older language than Python. (Python can detect types.) I am really confused why we are using Java. Isn't there a better language out there? I don't even think that Java is the industry standard these days.
